# VGA Controller
- In this project, a simple VGA (Video Graphics Array) controller shall be implemented using an
FPGA. 
- The VGA controller should be able to display images with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.

- Furthermore, it should be possible to select between three different images, depending on the
position of the two switches SW0 and SW1. 
- One of the images is read from the internal block memory. 
- Finally, depending on the position of another switch (SW2), a so called “movable object”
should be displayed, whose position can be controlled with the four push buttons BTNU, BTND,
BTNL and BTNR.
